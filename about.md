Hey, I'm Ben! I like to build things using technology and art. I work as a System and Network Administrator in the Kansas City area managing modern (and not-so-modern) systems at scale. I have a badass wife and a gremlin dog. I do some programming and 3d design, I run tabletop games, I play video games and make cool stuff.
