# Hi, I'm Ben

I’m a System and Network Administrator living in the Kansas City area. I’m currently employed at [Ad Astra](https://www.aais.com/) which means I’ve been working with computer systems in education and healthcare for over 17 years! I’m always interested to hear about new opportunities, feel free to reach out and say hello!
