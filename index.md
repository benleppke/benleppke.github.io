I’m a System and Network Administrator living in the Kansas City area. I currently work at [Ad Astra](https://www.aais.com/) and I’ve been working with computer systems in education and healthcare for over 20 years! I’m always interested to hear about new opportunities, feel free to reach out and say hello!
